I only have a free shinyapps account, so use is limited to 25 active hours per month

With this, you can view:

* The Premier League Table at a set date

* The Premier League Table between two dates - the media love to do this to see, for example, the table since Christmas or since a managerial sacking

* A lineplot of the weekly league position for each team

* A lineplot of the total number of points attained by each team, on a weekly basis.

The previous version for 2020/21 can be found here: Premier League Table

### Code for the lineplot was adapted from [Rob at R for Journalists](https://rforjournalists.com/2019/11/12/how-to-track-your-fantasy-football-league-using-r/).
### Code for extracting raw data and producing league tables adapted from [this article by Stewart Smith](https://rpubs.com/stewartmsmith/597789)
### Really cool site for obtaining sports teams colours https://teamcolorcodes.com/soccer/premier-league-color-codes/
